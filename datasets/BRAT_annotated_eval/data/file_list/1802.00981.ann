T1	Dataset_Sentence 14805 15063	For MNIST, we took 10,000 samples from the original test dataset (clearly, not using them later for testing) to pre-train the encodings, and 60,000 samples from the training dataset to simulate the online bandit with 10 arms corresponding to different digits
T2	Dataset 14809 14814	MNIST
T3	Dataset_Sentence 15065 15318	For STL-10, 100,000 samples of unlabeled data are used to pre-train the encodings; then the 5,000 test samples together with 8,000 training samples are combined to simulate the online bandit, again with 10 different arms corresponding to image classes 1
