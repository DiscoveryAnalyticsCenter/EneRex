T2	Dataset_Sentence 791 858	We then evaluate the models on the more natural SICK challenge data
T3	Dataset_Sentence 860 1072	Both models perform competitively on the SICK data and generalize well in all three experiments on simulated data, suggesting that they can learn suitable representations for logical inference in natural language
T4	Dataset 840 859	ICK challenge data.
