T1	Dataset_Sentence 992 1280	Two problems (Sketch-Photo and NIR-VIS) and three databases are selected to evaluate the proposed method. For Sketch-Photo problem, we obtain perfect results on the CUFS database. For NIR-VIS problem, we produce new state-of-the-art performance on the CASIA HFB and NIR-VIS 2.0 databases.

T5	Dataset_Sentence 4378 4740	For Sketch-Photo problem, perfect results are obtained on the CUFS  #b1  database. This is the first work that saturates the database. 3. Local RBMs are first used to learn the shared representations of heterogenous face images. By plugging the local RBMs into the framework, we get stateof-the-art results on the CASIA HFB  #b9  and NIR-VIS 2.0  #b10  databases
