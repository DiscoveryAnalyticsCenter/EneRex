T1	Dataset_Sentence 818 994	Experiments are carried out on five microarray datasets, and results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method in comparison with six state-of-art ECOC methods
T2	Dataset_Sentence 9381 9496	To validate the proposed algorithm, experiments are carried out on five multiclass datasets (as listed in Table 1).
T3	Lang_lib_Sentence 9777 9893	The last three ECOC methods are provided by ECOC library  #b4 , and the rest are supported by MATLAB 2016 toolboxes.

T5	Lang_lib 9821 9825	ECOC
T6	Dataset_Sentence 11844 12014	On the Breast data set, the accuracy rate N2 algorithm is 49% higher than OVA, 30% higher than the traditional ECOC, 25% higher than ECOCONE and 54% more than Forest-ECOC
T7	Dataset_Sentence 12911 13038	Fig.4 shows that the accuracies obtained by eight ECOC methods change with varying feature size over Cancers data set using NB.
T8	Dataset 13012 13019	Cancers
T9	Dataset 11851 11857	Breast
T10	Dataset_Sentence 11004 11172	When the original data sets appear high overlapping situation, especially the DLBCL dataset, the class exchange process is of higher probability to occur multiple times
T11	Dataset 11082 11087	DLBCL
T12	Dataset_Sentence 12383 12527	Although the N2 based approach wins most cases, the N3 algorithm just wins on the Leukemia data, achieving close performance to other algorithms
