T1	Dataset_Sentence 605 730	Since existing ground truth datasets are not sufficiently large to train a CNN, we generate a synthetic Flying Chairs dataset
T2	Dataset 699 722	synthetic Flying Chairs
T3	Dataset_Sentence 732 921	We show that networks trained on this unrealistic data still generalize very well to existing datasets such as Sintel and KITTI, achieving competitive accuracy at frame rates of 5 to 10 fps
T4	Dataset 843 849	Sintel
T5	Dataset 854 859	KITTI
T6	Comp_res_Sentence 3504 3598	Leveraging an efficient GPU implementation of CNNs, our method is faster than most competitors
T7	Comp_res 3528 3531	GPU
T8	Dataset_Sentence 16873 17015	We retrieve 964 images from Flickr 2 with a resolution of 1, 024 Ã— 768 from the categories 'city' (321), 'landscape' (129) and 'mountain' (514
T9	Comp_res_Sentence 18736 18805	To be reasonably quick, all these operations are processed on the GPU
T10	Comp_res 18802 18805	GPU
T11	Dataset_Sentence 19276 19409	We report the results of our networks on the Sintel, KITTI and Middlebury datasets, as well as on our synthetic Flying Chairs dataset
T12	Dataset 19321 19327	Sintel
T13	Dataset 19329 19334	KITTI
T14	Dataset 19339 19349	Middlebury
T15	Dataset 19378 19401	synthetic Flying Chairs
T16	Comp_res_Sentence 25704 25781	For both train-ing and testing of the networks we use an NVIDIA GTX Titan GPU
T17	Comp_res_Sentence 25761 25781	NVIDIA GTX Titan GPU
T18	Comp_res_Sentence 25783 25909	The CPU timings of DeepFlow and EpicFlow are taken from  #b29 , while the timing of LDOF was computed on a single 2.66GHz core
T19	Comp_res 25890 25909	single 2.66GHz core
